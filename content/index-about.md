# Who Am I?

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Marshall University currently working as a Database Systems Manager for the Mount Pleasant Police Department. Previously, I developed GIS mapping applications at TC Energy, building robust solutions with React, TypeScript, and AWS infrastructure.

While I excel in modern web technologies, I'm equally passionate about compiled languages. My current technical adventure? Mastering Golang to expand my backend expertise and build high-performance systems.

I'm driven by creating efficient, user-friendly solutions that solve real-world problemsâ€”whether that's through clean frontend interfaces or optimized backend services.
